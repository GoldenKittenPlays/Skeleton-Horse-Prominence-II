This mod adds a special item called the Stormcaller’s Sigil. When a player uses it:
- It starts a thunderstorm
- Finds the nearest stronghold
- Launches the Stormcaller's Sigil(eye of ender) toward it
- Summons lightning and a glowing skeleton horse named StormCaller in the direction of the stronghold
- This item is one time use
There's also a crafting item called the Stormcaller’s Remnant that helps players get the Sigil. The recipe changes depending on what other mods are installed, so it always works without needing separate versions.

The mods I am referring to:
